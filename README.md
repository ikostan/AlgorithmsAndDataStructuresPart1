# Algorithms and Data Structures - Part 1

### Description:<br/>
In this course we will look at the core data structures and algorithms used in everyday applications. We will discuss the trade-offs involved with choosing each data structure, along with traversal, retrieval, and update algorithms. This is part 1 of a two-part series of courses covering algorithms and data structures. In this part we cover linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash tables.
